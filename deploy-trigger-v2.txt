Deploy trigger v2.5 - Improved serverless database timeout handling

Fixes:
1. âœ… Skip directory creation (generated/, templates/) on serverless environment
2. âœ… Proper module.exports for Vercel serverless function deployment
3. âœ… Environment-aware startup logic (serverless vs traditional server)
4. âœ… Fixed route precedence - root path "/" now properly serves index.html
5. ðŸ”„ Optimized database connection for serverless

Critical improvements:
- Increased timeouts from 5000ms to 15000ms for cold starts
- Removed database initialization from serverless startup completely
- On-demand connections only when needed (no persistent connections)
- Simplified connection logic to reduce startup overhead

Should fix "Query read timeout" errors and 500 responses.
