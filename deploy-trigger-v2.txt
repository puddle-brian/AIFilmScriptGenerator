Deploy trigger v2.4 - Fixed 500 errors with simplified database connection

Fixes:
1. âœ… Skip directory creation (generated/, templates/) on serverless environment
2. âœ… Proper module.exports for Vercel serverless function deployment
3. âœ… Environment-aware startup logic (serverless vs traditional server)
4. âœ… Fixed route precedence - root path "/" now properly serves index.html
5. ðŸ”„ Reverted Pool to Client with serverless optimizations

Issue: Pool connection caused 500 Internal Server Errors
Solution: Using Client with:
- SSL configuration for Vercel environment
- Shorter timeouts (5000ms) for serverless
- On-demand connection testing instead of persistent connections
- Simplified authentication middleware without Promise.race complexity

This should fix the 500 errors while maintaining performance improvements.
