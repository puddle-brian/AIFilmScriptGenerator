Deploy trigger v2.6 - Pool-based serverless with enhanced debugging

Fixes:
1. âœ… Skip directory creation (generated/, templates/) on serverless environment
2. âœ… Proper module.exports for Vercel serverless function deployment
3. âœ… Environment-aware startup logic (serverless vs traditional server)
4. âœ… Fixed route precedence - root path "/" now properly serves index.html
5. ðŸ”„ Serverless-optimized Pool connections with debugging

Key changes:
- Using Pool for serverless with optimized settings (max: 3, min: 0)
- 15-second timeouts for connection acquisition
- Automatic connection cleanup (idle: 10s, evict: 30s)
- Enhanced logging for authentication debugging
- Database initialization with error handling
- Pool propagateCreateError: false for resilience

Should resolve "Query read timeout" and provide detailed error logs.
