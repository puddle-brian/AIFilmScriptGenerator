Deploy trigger v2.2 - Fixed Vercel route precedence issue

Fixes:
1. âœ… Skip directory creation (generated/, templates/) on serverless environment
2. âœ… Proper module.exports for Vercel serverless function deployment
3. âœ… Environment-aware startup logic (serverless vs traditional server)
4. ðŸ†• Fixed route precedence - root path "/" now properly serves index.html

Issue: The catch-all route "/(.*)" was intercepting root requests before static files
Solution: Added explicit route for "/" to serve index.html before catch-all
