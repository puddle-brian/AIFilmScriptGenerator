# 🚀 PHASE 2A: ROUTE EXTRACTION - SESSION PROMPT

## 📋 **MISSION BRIEFING**
I'm continuing a comprehensive refactoring project for my AI Film Script Generator application. **Phase 1 (Service Layer) is complete** and I'm ready to begin **Phase 2A (Route Extraction)**.

## ✅ **PHASE 1 ACHIEVEMENTS - COMPLETED**
- **Service Layer**: 6 core services extracted and battle-tested
  - `DatabaseService`, `AuthService`, `GenerationService`, `CreditService`, `LibraryService`, `ProjectService`
- **Database Migration**: 22 database patterns migrated to service methods
- **UserService**: Expanded to 24 comprehensive methods 
- **Test Coverage**: 23/23 tests passing (100% success rate maintained)
- **Code Reduction**: 771 lines eliminated from server.js
- **Current State**: server.js reduced from 8,971 → ~8,200 lines
- **Zero Regressions**: All functionality preserved

## 🎯 **PHASE 2A OBJECTIVE**
Extract route handlers from the massive `server.js` file into focused, maintainable route modules:

```
Current:  server.js (~8,200 lines)
Target:   server.js (100 lines) + route files (300-500 lines each)
Goal:     Extract ~8,100 lines into 6 focused route modules
```

## 📁 **ROUTE FILES TO CREATE**

### **Priority Order (Start with #1):**
1. **`routes/auth.js`** (~400 lines)
   - Authentication endpoints (login, register, password reset)
   - Session management
   - User profile operations
   - **Safest extraction target**

2. **`routes/generation.js`** (~500 lines)
   - AI generation endpoints (dialogue, structure, plot points, scenes)
   - Template management
   - Progress tracking

3. **`routes/projects.js`** (~400 lines)
   - Project CRUD operations
   - Project sharing and collaboration
   - Project export functionality

4. **`routes/payments.js`** (~300 lines)
   - Stripe integration
   - Credit purchasing
   - Payment webhooks

5. **`routes/library.js`** (~350 lines)
   - Character and location management
   - Library sharing
   - Template operations

6. **`routes/admin.js`** (~250 lines)
   - Admin dashboard
   - User management
   - System monitoring

## 🛡️ **PROVEN METHODOLOGY**
Use the **exact same incremental approach** that achieved 100% success in Phase 1:

### **Extraction Process:**
1. **Identify target functionality** in server.js
2. **Create new route file** with Express Router
3. **Extract route handlers** with proper imports
4. **Update server.js** to use new route file
5. **Run test suite** - must pass 23/23 tests
6. **Commit changes** with descriptive message
7. **Repeat for next route file**

### **Safety Measures:**
- ✅ **One route file at a time** - never extract multiple simultaneously
- ✅ **Test after each extraction** - 23/23 tests must pass
- ✅ **Commit after each success** - clean rollback points
- ✅ **Use service layer** - routes should call service methods, not raw database queries

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **Route File Structure:**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Import required services
const authService = require('../src/services/AuthService');
const userService = require('../src/services/UserService');

// Route handlers
router.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  // Use service methods, not direct database queries
  const user = await userService.getUserByUsername(username);
  // ... rest of logic
});

module.exports = router;
```

### **Server.js Updates:**
```javascript
// Replace extracted routes with:
const authRoutes = require('./routes/auth');
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
```

## 📊 **CURRENT PROJECT STATE**

### **File Structure:**
- `server.js` - ~8,200 lines (needs route extraction)
- `src/services/` - 6 service files (ready to use)
- `routes/` - empty directory (ready for route files)
- `middleware/` - contains `auth.js` (basic auth middleware exists)

### **Service Layer Available:**
- **AuthService** - authentication operations
- **UserService** - 24 user management methods
- **GenerationService** - AI generation operations
- **CreditService** - credit management with transaction logging
- **LibraryService** - library operations
- **ProjectService** - project management
- **DatabaseService** - database connection management

### **Test Coverage:**
- **23 tests** covering all core functionality
- **100% pass rate** maintained throughout Phase 1
- **Must maintain 23/23 passing** after each extraction

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **Step 1: Start with routes/auth.js**
Begin with authentication routes because:
- ✅ **Well-defined scope** - clear auth-related endpoints
- ✅ **UserService ready** - all user operations already abstracted
- ✅ **Lower risk** - authentication is isolated functionality
- ✅ **Good test coverage** - auth endpoints well-tested

### **Step 2: Validate Extraction**
After creating `routes/auth.js`:
- ✅ **Run tests** - `npm test` must show 23/23 passing
- ✅ **Manual testing** - verify login/register still works
- ✅ **Check server.js** - confirm routes properly integrated
- ✅ **Commit changes** - clean git history

### **Step 3: Repeat Process**
Continue with `routes/generation.js`, then `routes/projects.js`, etc.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

1. **NEVER extract multiple route files simultaneously** - one at a time only
2. **ALWAYS run tests after each extraction** - 23/23 must pass
3. **USE service layer methods** - don't duplicate database logic
4. **COMMIT after each success** - maintain clean rollback points
5. **FOLLOW proven methodology** - same approach that succeeded in Phase 1

## 📈 **SUCCESS METRICS**
- **Target**: Extract ~8,100 lines from server.js
- **Result**: server.js reduced to ~100 lines (entry point only)
- **Architecture**: 6 focused route modules (300-500 lines each)
- **Test Coverage**: 23/23 tests passing throughout
- **Zero Regressions**: All functionality preserved

## 🎉 **EXPECTED OUTCOME**
After Phase 2A completion:
- **Maintainable architecture** with focused route modules
- **Scalable codebase** ready for team collaboration
- **Industry-standard file sizes** (300-500 lines per module)
- **Solid foundation** for Phase 2B (Frontend Components)
