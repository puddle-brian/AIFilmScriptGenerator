// STRUCTURE GENERATION TEMPLATE
// This template creates the overall story structure (acts, themes, progression)
// When you click "Generate Structure" in the app, this exact text gets sent to the AI
// 
// PLACEHOLDERS EXPLAINED:
// {{PROJECT_TITLE}} = Your story title (e.g., "Lost Mirror")
// {{PROJECT_LOGLINE}} = Your one-sentence story summary
// {{PROJECT_CHARACTERS}} = Your main character descriptions  
// {{TEMPLATE_NAME}} = Structure template name (e.g., "Three Act Structure")
// {{INFLUENCE_PROMPT}} = Any directorial/film influences you specified (appears at the top as prose)
// {{STRUCTURE_DESCRIPTION}} = Description of the structure template you chose
// {{TEMPLATE_STRUCTURE}} = The JSON structure of the template
//
// HOW TO EDIT THIS TEMPLATE:
// ✅ Change any instructions to the AI (like "focus on visual storytelling")
// ✅ Add requirements (like "include a plot twist in act 2")
// ✅ Modify the tone or style of instructions
// ❌ Don't change anything in {{DOUBLE_CURLY_BRACES}} - those get filled in automatically

{{INFLUENCE_PROMPT}}Based on the following story concept, generate a detailed plot structure using the {{TEMPLATE_NAME}} format that embodies these artistic sensibilities:

Story Details:
- Title: {{PROJECT_TITLE}}
- Logline: {{PROJECT_LOGLINE}}
- Main Characters: {{PROJECT_CHARACTERS}}

STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:
{{STRUCTURE_DESCRIPTION}}

Template Structure Elements: {{TEMPLATE_STRUCTURE}}

CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR EVENT-DRIVEN STORYTELLING:
1. Each act description must focus on CONCRETE ACTIONS and EVENTS that happen - not internal feelings or character psychology
2. Describe what the audience will SEE happening on screen - external, visual story beats
3. Show character development through ACTIONS and CHOICES, not internal monologue or emotional states
4. Focus on plot events that connect causally - what happens BECAUSE of previous events
5. Each act should describe key incidents, confrontations, discoveries, or turning points
6. Avoid describing what characters "feel," "realize," or "understand" - instead describe what they DO
7. Character development should be evident through their changing behavior and choices across acts

Generate a detailed breakdown for each structural element. Each element should have:
- A clear title
- A 2-3 sentence description of the KEY EVENTS and ACTIONS that occur in this act
- Key character developments (shown through actions, not feelings)
- Important plot points (concrete incidents that advance the story)

Return the response as a valid JSON object with each structural element as a property. 

CRITICAL: Use the EXACT structure keys from the Template Structure Elements above. Do not create your own keys or names.

IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY valid JSON, with no additional text, markdown formatting, or explanations. Start with { and end with }.

The JSON structure should match the Template Structure Elements exactly, using the same keys and updating the names/descriptions based on the story content while preserving the template's structural intent.
