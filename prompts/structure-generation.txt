// STRUCTURE GENERATION TEMPLATE
// This template creates the overall story structure (acts, themes, progression)
// When you click "Generate Structure" in the app, this exact text gets sent to the AI
// 
// PLACEHOLDERS EXPLAINED:
// {{PROJECT_TITLE}} = Your story title (e.g., "Lost Mirror")
// {{PROJECT_LOGLINE}} = Your one-sentence story summary
// {{PROJECT_CHARACTERS}} = Your main character descriptions  
// {{PROJECT_TONE}} = The mood/genre of your story (e.g., "Horror", "Comedy")
// {{TOTAL_SCENES}} = How many scenes you want (e.g., 70)
// {{TEMPLATE_NAME}} = Structure template name (e.g., "Three Act Structure")
// {{INFLUENCE_PROMPT}} = Any directorial/film influences you specified
// {{DIRECTORIAL_INFLUENCES}} = Directors that inspire your style
// {{SCREENWRITING_INFLUENCES}} = Screenwriters that inspire your style  
// {{FILM_INFLUENCES}} = Specific films that inspire your story
// {{TEMPLATE_DESCRIPTION}} = Description of the structure template you chose
//
// HOW TO EDIT THIS TEMPLATE:
// ✅ Change any instructions to the AI (like "focus on visual storytelling")
// ✅ Add requirements (like "include a plot twist in act 2")
// ✅ Modify the tone or style of instructions
// ❌ Don't change anything in {{DOUBLE_CURLY_BRACES}} - those get filled in automatically

{{INFLUENCE_PROMPT}}Based on the following story concept, generate a detailed plot structure using the {{TEMPLATE_NAME}} format that embodies these artistic sensibilities:

Story Details:
- Title: {{PROJECT_TITLE}}
- Logline: {{PROJECT_LOGLINE}}
- Main Characters: {{PROJECT_CHARACTERS}}
- Tone: {{PROJECT_TONE}}
- Target Scene Count: {{TOTAL_SCENES}} scenes{{INFLUENCES_SECTION}}

CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR EVENT-DRIVEN STORYTELLING:
1. Each act description must focus on CONCRETE ACTIONS and EVENTS that happen - not internal feelings or character psychology
2. Describe what the audience will SEE happening on screen - external, visual story beats
3. Show character development through ACTIONS and CHOICES, not internal monologue or emotional states
4. Focus on plot events that connect causally - what happens BECAUSE of previous events
5. Each act should describe key incidents, confrontations, discoveries, or turning points
6. Avoid describing what characters "feel," "realize," or "understand" - instead describe what they DO
7. Character development should be evident through their changing behavior and choices across acts

Generate a detailed breakdown for each structural element. Each element should have:
- A clear title
- A 2-3 sentence description of the KEY EVENTS and ACTIONS that occur in this act
- Key character developments (shown through actions, not feelings)
- Important plot points (concrete incidents that advance the story)

Return the response as a valid JSON object with each structural element as a property. 

IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY valid JSON, with no additional text, markdown formatting, or explanations. Start with { and end with }.

Example format:
{
  "act1_setup": {
    "name": "Act 1: Setup",
    "description": "Character performs specific actions that establish their world and routine. Key events occur that set up the story's central conflict."
  },
  "act1_inciting_incident": {
    "name": "Inciting Incident", 
    "description": "A specific event disrupts the character's normal world and forces them into the main story conflict."
  }
}
