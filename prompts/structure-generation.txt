// STRUCTURE GENERATION TEMPLATE
// This template creates the overall story structure (acts, themes, progression)
// When you click "Generate Structure" in the app, this exact text gets sent to the AI
// 
// PLACEHOLDERS EXPLAINED:
// {{PROJECT_TITLE}} = Your story title (e.g., "Lost Mirror")
// {{PROJECT_LOGLINE}} = Your one-sentence story summary
// {{PROJECT_CHARACTERS}} = Your main character descriptions  
// {{TEMPLATE_NAME}} = Structure template name (e.g., "Three Act Structure")
// {{INFLUENCE_PROMPT}} = Any directorial/film influences you specified (appears at the top as prose)
// {{STRUCTURE_DESCRIPTION}} = Description of the structure template you chose
// {{TEMPLATE_STRUCTURE}} = The JSON structure of the template
//
// HOW TO EDIT THIS TEMPLATE:
// ‚úÖ Change any instructions to the AI (like "focus on visual storytelling")
// ‚úÖ Add requirements (like "include a plot twist in act 2")
// ‚úÖ Modify the tone or style of instructions
// ‚ùå Don't change anything in {{DOUBLE_CURLY_BRACES}} - those get filled in automatically

{{INFLUENCE_PROMPT}}Based on the following story concept, generate a detailed plot structure using the {{TEMPLATE_NAME}} format that embodies these artistic sensibilities:

Story Details:
- Title: {{PROJECT_TITLE}}
- Logline: {{PROJECT_LOGLINE}}
- Main Characters: {{PROJECT_CHARACTERS}}

STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:
{{STRUCTURE_DESCRIPTION}}

Template Structure Elements: {{TEMPLATE_STRUCTURE}}

CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR EVENT-DRIVEN STORYTELLING:
1. Each act description must focus on CONCRETE ACTIONS and EVENTS that happen - not internal feelings or character psychology
2. Describe what the audience will SEE happening on screen - external, visual story beats
3. Show character development through ACTIONS and CHOICES, not internal monologue or emotional states
4. Focus on plot events that connect causally - what happens BECAUSE of previous events
5. Each act should describe key incidents, confrontations, discoveries, or turning points
6. Avoid describing what characters "feel," "realize," or "understand" - instead describe what they DO
7. Character development should be evident through their changing behavior and choices across acts

üÜï HANDLING USER CREATIVE DIRECTIONS:
8. When an act has "User Creative Direction" in the template structure, you MUST incorporate those specific creative elements into your generated description for that act
9. These directions are mandatory creative constraints (like "Blue switch up: the world transforms to a blue hue")
10. Blend these user directions seamlessly with the template's structural purpose - don't just append them
11. The user direction should influence HOW the act's events unfold, not replace the act's structural function

Generate a detailed breakdown for each structural element. Each element should have:
- A clear title
- A 2-3 sentence description of the KEY EVENTS and ACTIONS that occur in this act
- Key character developments (shown through actions, not feelings)
- Important plot points (concrete incidents that advance the story)

Return the response as a valid JSON object with each structural element as a property. 

CRITICAL: Use the EXACT structure keys from the Template Structure Elements above. Do not create your own keys or names.

IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY valid JSON, with no additional text, markdown formatting, or explanations. Start with { and end with }.

JSON FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- All string values must be properly escaped (use \" for quotes, \n for line breaks)
- Keep descriptions concise but detailed (2-3 sentences max per element)
- Avoid using unescaped quotes, apostrophes, or line breaks within string values
- Use simple, clear language that focuses on concrete actions and events
- Ensure all strings are properly terminated with closing quotes

The JSON structure should match the Template Structure Elements exactly, using the same keys and updating the names/descriptions based on the story content while preserving the template's structural intent.
