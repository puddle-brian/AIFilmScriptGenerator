// INDIVIDUAL PLOT POINT SCENE GENERATION TEMPLATE
// This template generates multiple scenes that implement a SINGLE plot point
// When you generate scenes for a plot point, this exact text gets sent to the AI
//
// PLACEHOLDERS EXPLAINED:
// {{HIERARCHICAL_CONTEXT}} = Complete story context including all levels
// {{PLOT_POINT}} = The specific plot point being implemented into scenes
// {{SCENE_COUNT}} = Number of scenes to generate for this plot point (e.g., 3-4)
// {{PLOT_POINT_INDEX}} = Which plot point this is (for context)
// {{IS_KEY_PLOT}} = Whether this is a key plot point requiring more dramatic weight
//
// HOW TO EDIT THIS TEMPLATE:
// ✅ Modify how scenes break down plot points into sequences
// ✅ Change the level of detail you want in each scene
// ✅ Add specific requirements for visual storytelling within plot points
// ❌ Don't change anything in double curly braces

{{HIERARCHICAL_CONTEXT}}

PLOT POINT SCENE SEQUENCE GENERATION:
Generate exactly {{SCENE_COUNT}} scenes that collectively implement this specific plot point:
"{{PLOT_POINT}}"

This is {{IS_KEY_PLOT}} plot point {{PLOT_POINT_INDEX}} in the story structure.

SCENE SEQUENCE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Break this single plot point into a {{SCENE_COUNT}}-scene progression that shows the complete dramatic arc
2. Each scene should advance this plot point's specific purpose step-by-step
3. Create a natural causal flow between scenes in this sequence: Scene 1 leads to Scene 2, which leads to Scene 3, etc.
4. Vary scene types within the sequence: some dialogue-heavy, some action, some introspective
5. Each scene needs: title, location, time_of_day, description (2-3 sentences), characters, emotional_beats
6. Scenes should feel like organic parts of a sequence that collectively fulfill the plot point
7. Show visual, external story beats that can be filmed - what does the audience SEE happening?
8. Use concrete locations and specific time pressures to create cinematic tension
9. ALWAYS surprise the audience with unpredictable actions and novel ways of moving scenes forward

PLOT POINT BREAKDOWN STRATEGY:
- Scene 1: Set up the situation or conflict described in the plot point
- Scene 2: Develop/complicate the situation (show obstacles, resistance, or escalation)  
- Scene 3: Resolve/conclude the plot point (show outcome, consequence, or transition)
- Scene 4 (if applicable): Bridge to the next plot point or show aftermath

{{IS_KEY_PLOT}} CONSIDERATIONS:
{{#if IS_KEY_PLOT}}
Since this is a KEY plot point, give it extra dramatic weight:
- Include more character development and emotional stakes
- Create more visual spectacle or memorable moments
- Show how this plot point changes the character's trajectory
- Make the sequence more cinematically striking
{{else}}
This is a regular plot point, so focus on:
- Efficient story progression that serves the overall narrative
- Clear cause-and-effect within the sequence
- Smooth transitions that maintain story momentum
{{/if}}

HIERARCHICAL CONTEXT INTEGRATION:
- Reference the complete story context to maintain character consistency
- Honor the structure template and act purpose established earlier
- Connect causally to previous plot points while setting up future ones
- Maintain the established tone and visual style throughout
