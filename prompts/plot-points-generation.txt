{{HIERARCHICAL_CONTEXT}}

TASK: Generate {{PLOT_POINT_COUNT}} plot points for the current story act.

KEY REQUIREMENTS:
â€¢ Each plot point = a concrete ACTION or EVENT (not feelings)
â€¢ Connect causally: if there's a ðŸ”— connection above, start from that
â€¢ Show character through choices under pressure
â€¢ Create visual, filmable moments with specific locations
â€¢ CRITICAL: Use strict "BUT/THEREFORE" logic for dramatic flow

CAUSAL FLOW RULES:
â€¢ First plot point: Establishes the situation for this act
â€¢ Subsequent plot points: MUST start with "But" (conflict/complication) or "Therefore" (consequence/progress)
â€¢ "But" = introduces conflict, obstacles, or unexpected complications
â€¢ "Therefore" = shows consequences, progress, or logical results
â€¢ Avoid weak "and then" connections - force dramatic causality

AVOID: Internal thoughts, generic locations, passive descriptions

Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "plotPoints": [
{{DYNAMIC_EXAMPLES}}
    // Generate exactly {{PLOT_POINT_COUNT}} plot points as simple strings
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Each plot point must be a simple string, not an object. Do not include actionVerbs, visualDetails, or any other properties - just the plot point description as a string.
