// PLOT POINTS GENERATION TEMPLATE
// This template generates plot points that break down story acts into specific scenes
// When you generate plot points for an act, this exact text gets sent to the AI
//
// PLACEHOLDERS EXPLAINED:
// {{PROJECT_TITLE}} = Your story title
// {{PROJECT_LOGLINE}} = Your story's one-sentence summary
// {{ACT_NAME}} = Name of the current act being broken down
// {{ACT_DESCRIPTION}} = What happens in this act
// {{SCENES_PER_ACT}} = How many scenes this act should have
// {{HIERARCHICAL_CONTEXT}} = Context from previous acts and plot points
//
// HOW TO EDIT THIS TEMPLATE:
// ✅ Modify instructions about how plot points should be created
// ✅ Change the level of detail you want in each plot point
// ✅ Add specific requirements for pacing or character development
// ❌ Don't change anything in {{DOUBLE_CURLY_BRACES}}

// TODO: This template will be populated with the actual plot points prompt in Phase 3
// For now, this is a placeholder to test the template loading system
