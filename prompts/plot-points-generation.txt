{{HIERARCHICAL_CONTEXT}}

Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "plotPoints": [
{{DYNAMIC_EXAMPLES}}
    // Generate exactly {{PLOT_POINT_COUNT}} plot points as simple strings
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Each plot point must be a simple string, not an object. Do not include actionVerbs, visualDetails, or any other properties - just the plot point description as a string.
