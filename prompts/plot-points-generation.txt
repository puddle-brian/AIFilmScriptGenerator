// PLOT POINTS GENERATION TEMPLATE
// This template generates plot points that break down story acts into specific scenes
// When you generate plot points for an act, this exact text gets sent to the AI
//
// PLACEHOLDERS EXPLAINED:
// {{HIERARCHICAL_CONTEXT}} = Complete story context including previous acts and structure
// {{PLOT_POINT_COUNT}} = Number of plot points to generate (usually 4)
// {{FINAL_SCENE_COUNT}} = Total scenes this act will expand to (e.g., 14)
//
// HOW TO EDIT THIS TEMPLATE:
// ✅ Modify instructions about how plot points should be created
// ✅ Change the level of detail you want in each plot point
// ✅ Add specific requirements for pacing or character development
// ❌ Don't change anything in double curly braces

{{HIERARCHICAL_CONTEXT}}

PLOT POINTS GENERATION WITH INTER-ACT CAUSALITY:
1. Break down this story act into {{PLOT_POINT_COUNT}} causally connected plot points (these will be expanded into {{FINAL_SCENE_COUNT}} total scenes)
2. CRITICAL: If previous acts' plot points are shown above, your FIRST plot point must logically continue from the last plot point of the previous act
3. Each plot point must describe a CONCRETE ACTION or EVENT that happens - not internal feelings
4. Focus on external, visual story beats that could be filmed - what does the audience SEE happening?
5. Plot points should connect causally using "BUT" (conflict) and "THEREFORE" (consequence)
6. Show character development through ACTIONS and CHOICES, not internal monologue
7. Each plot point should create a specific dramatic situation or encounter
8. Make events unpredictable and cinematic while serving the character arc
9. Some plot points will be expanded into multiple scenes (sequences) to reach the target of {{FINAL_SCENE_COUNT}} scenes for this act

INTER-ACT CAUSAL CONNECTION:
- If there's a "CONNECT FROM" instruction above, begin this act as a direct consequence of that previous plot point
- Use "THEREFORE" to show how this act follows logically from the previous act's conclusion
- Don't repeat previous events, but build upon their consequences
- Maintain character momentum and story energy across act boundaries

CHARACTER ARC THROUGH ACTION:
- Show character growth through CHOICES under pressure
- Reveal personality through HOW characters act, not what they think
- Use physical behavior to show emotional states
- Force characters to make decisions that reveal their true nature

CINEMATIC SPECIFICITY:
- Include specific locations that serve the story (not just "a room")
- Add time pressure or urgency to create tension
- Introduce physical obstacles or concrete goals
- Create visual conflicts that can be filmed dramatically

EXAMPLES OF GOOD PLOT POINTS:
- "She saves a child from a burning building"
- "Police surround him with weapons drawn"  
- "He breaks into an abandoned school to sleep"
- "He must choose between saving his friend or escaping before the building collapses"
- "She discovers the hidden evidence just as her phone battery dies"

AVOID internal states like "feels lonely" or "contemplates" - show these through what the character DOES.

Create {{PLOT_POINT_COUNT}} plot points using "But and Therefore" logic to create dramatic tension and causal flow.

Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:

  "plotPoints": [
    "Plot point 1 that establishes the situation for this act",
    "But plot point 2 that introduces conflict or complication", 
    "Therefore plot point 3 that shows the consequence or progress",
    "Therefore plot point 4 that concludes this act's progression"
