// SCENE GENERATION TEMPLATE
// This template generates individual scenes based on plot points
// When you generate scenes from plot points, this exact text gets sent to the AI

// PLACEHOLDERS EXPLAINED:
// {{PROJECT_TITLE}} = Your story title
// {{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}} = What should happen in this specific scene
// {{SCENE_CHARACTER_DEVELOPMENT}} = How characters should grow in this scene
// {{PREVIOUS_SCENES_SUMMARY}} = Context from scenes that came before
// {{ASSIGNED_PLOT_POINT}} = The specific plot point this scene should fulfill
//
// HOW TO EDIT THIS TEMPLATE:
// ✅ Change how detailed you want scenes to be
// ✅ Modify the format (more action, more dialogue, etc.)
// ✅ Add specific requirements for visual storytelling
// ❌ Don't change anything in {{DOUBLE_CURLY_BRACES}}

// TODO: This template will be populated with the actual scene prompt in Phase 2
