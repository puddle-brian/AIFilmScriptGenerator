// SCENE GENERATION TEMPLATE
// This template generates multiple scenes for story acts
// When you generate scenes for an act, this exact text gets sent to the AI
//
// PLACEHOLDERS EXPLAINED:
// {{HIERARCHICAL_CONTEXT}} = Complete story context including plot points, structure, etc.
// {{SCENE_COUNT}} = Number of scenes to generate (e.g., 3)
//
// HOW TO EDIT THIS TEMPLATE:
// ✅ Change how detailed you want scenes to be
// ✅ Modify the format (more action, more dialogue, etc.)
// ✅ Add specific requirements for visual storytelling
// ❌ Don't change anything in double curly braces

{{HIERARCHICAL_CONTEXT}}

SCENE GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create exactly {{SCENE_COUNT}} scenes that develop this structural element
2. Each scene should advance the plot and character development described above
3. Make scenes cinematic and specific, not just plot summaries
4. Vary scene types: some dialogue-heavy, some action, some introspective
5. Each scene needs: title, location, time_of_day, description (2-3 sentences), characters, emotional_beats
6. Use any available plot points as guidance for narrative flow
7. ALWAYS surprise the audience with unpredictable actions and novel ways of moving scenes forward - avoid static or predictable transitions that feel formulaic

The scenes you generate should feel like organic parts of the complete story structure, not isolated fragments.
